# Rust Physics Simulation

A simple physics simulation built with Rust. Goal of the project was to learn basic rust while doing something fun.

## Implementation

Implementation is not the most efficient but works well up to 10000 particles.

Collision detection: a simple collision detection algorithm is used to find and resolve collisions. Approach similar to sweep and prune is used for speed.

Forces: Arbitrary forces can be applied and resolved on each particles, feel free to edit the code to experiment.
